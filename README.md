# Parcel test repo

Hi guys.

This was the `parcel-plugin-static-files-copy` demo, that solved the "my images won't show up" issue.

## Install
To install, run `npm install` once you've cloned/downloaded the project

## Running
 - run `parcel index.html` to see it in action
 - run `parcel build index.html` to build for deployment
 - run `parcel build index.html --public-url ./` if you will not be deploying to the root of your website

## It also
 - parses/compiles the SASS file
 - shows this little sass breakpoint trick
 - shows how I deal with the .gitignore when using parcel
 - shows how easy Markdown is (open README.md in your editor)

## it does not
 - show how modules are used
 - look, even remotely, good
